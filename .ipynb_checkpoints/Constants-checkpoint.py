Cans should always be shown icy cold with lots of condensation.
Vodka Cranberry is the primary can, with alt flavors as secondary.
RTD Can should be the primary focus of the shot, with any ancillary activity or objects in the background, but need a very clear, tight read on the Vodka Cranberry can within each shot.
If the GENAi tool has a difficult time with people, these can all be scenic scenarios without people or just with hands.
“AI Talent”: Absolut MOC includes a diverse, younger, and stylish female demographic, while golf has historically been seen as a male-dominated sport. The goal is to showcase a variety of groups, including vibrant, fashionable female friends, as well as more traditional male groups enjoying the game.

GENIE INDIA PILOT BRIEF | OAKEN GLOW SODA
ABOUT THE BRAND
Once in a year comes a product that redefines the category, thinks differently, does differently and kicks off a new era. One such disruptor has been the launch of India’s first true smoky premium whisky: SEAGRAMS OAKEN GLOW. In a market full of regular whiskies that cater to the traditional taste palette, here’s something that stands out with its differentiated taste. Oaken Glow is an entry-level premium whisky brand that embodies boldness & unconventionality. With its distinctive smoky flavor, it appeals to individuals who dare to challenge the norms and embrace life. It is a whisky made for bold moments, whether that’s exploring unchartered paths or firing up the mundane moments with friends.

ABSOLUT PRIDE 2022 THE BRIEF
As a brand that has inclusion and diversity at its core, and a strong legacy of partnering with the LGBTQIA+ community, Absolut can do more to showcase its commitment to this community in India.
We have always been a queer ally in India; it is time now to have a meaningful and authentic conversation that helps us walk the talk.
MARKETING OBJECTIVES
We want to become the spirit of positive change for the new generation.
As a result of this campaign, we want to build brand equity and strengthen our emotional connect with our strategic target (including members of the queer community + allies).
UNIVERSAL CONSUMER CHALLENGE
‘Today, every brand wants to leverage the LGBTQIA+ community to seem more woke and progressive, but I know most of this is just pink washing, and opportunistic and it is often difficult to know who is authentic about their support. I want to connect with a brand that truly understands and gets the LGBTQIA+ community and most importantly walks the talk and aspires to drive true change’.
INDIA CONSUMER CHALLENGE
“India has made great strides on the legal front when it has come to the LGBTQ+ community- but has anything really changed at a societal and familial level?”
THE ABSOLUT CONTEXT
Why can we truly own and champion this space? A brand that, since the very beginning, kept challenging labels, exclusivity and closed-mindedness.
PROGRESSION IS IN OUR DNA
OUR AMBITION FOR INDIA
Create a powerful campaign that comes from a place of authenticity and actual understanding of the LGBTQIA+ community in India, and includes:
Hero assets
Digital/social elements
Instigation acts
Collaborations/Influencers
BTL/L3F elements
THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND
This is a thematic campaign strongly linked to our purpose of Creating a more inclusive world.
We have a global big idea of “Create Better Together”- this work should talk to that.
We want to work with change agents to also make a meaningful impact- beyond just communication.
Power not Pity: Ensure that the tone & vibe is empowering and fun. We’re here to celebrate and help to inspire change through positivity.
We need to consider intersectionality throughout and ensure diverse representation within the community as well.
Attitudes towards the queer community vary in India- so we will need specific interventions for Metro and Tier-1.
OUR STRATEGIC TARGET OF PROGRESSIVE CONNECTORS
They are hyper-connected on- and off-line, and they like linking friends together – creating their “family of friends”. They see the power of coming together to create social change.
Open-minded, inclusive and curious, striving for diversity.
Looking for progression, moving forward – developing and learning new things and meet new people to enrich their lives.
THE GEN-Z AUDIENCE CHALLENGE
ALMOST 1 IN 4 ACTIVELY SEEK-OUT BRANDS WITH VALUES THEY SHARE – PLUS THEY WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.
1 IN 6 IDENTIFY AS QUEER.
7 IN 10 MORE LIKELY TO BUY PRODUCTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIAL CAUSES.
THE THOUGHT
While the cultural, political & legal backdrop has changed dramatically since Absolut first began working with the queer community in 1981, nearly 3 in 4 gen z-ers still feel rejection from family when they express an identity that’s isn’t heterosexual. This feeling of alienation/ rejection with one’s family has only increased during the pandemic.
Family Prejudice, Lack of Safe Spaces: What the Pandemic Has Meant for India's LGBTQI Community.
Often without the support of their biological family, members of the queer community in India find their support structures in others like them- their people. A family of choice, and not the one they were born with. People with whom they can safely explore their own identity, be themselves and find their voice. This is their safe space.
SINGLE MINDED MESSAGE
Under the CEP Create Better Together.
‘As an LGBTQIA+ ally, Absolut wants to Celebrate diversity and promote inclusivity across the community in India by highlighting an important cause for the community.
DELIVERABLES
The key evaluation criteria the campaign will be judged against:
Increase in Share of Conversation (Connect) & Brand Affinity (Convince) that drives high relevancy.
Brand KPI (Equity)-Improvement in PRIME metrics (Uplift in Brand Closeness & Spontaneous awareness & Consideration among the PCs).
WHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOK LIKE?
Right on CEP: inclusive, show wide representation of the community and have a strong POV.
The delivery must include assets for always-on that are adaptable to major local LGBTQIA+ cultural tentpoles.
We celebrate the community. Tone must be uplifting.
The story must be compelling enough to deliver a PR-hook for activation in market.
MANDATORIES
It must be able to live through OOH and digital (Social Media, BVOD).
Brand communications must conform to Pernod Ricard Code of Communications.
PAST PARTNER LEARNINGS
MARKETS (R)esponsible (A)ccountable (C)onsult (S)upport (I)nform
KEEPING BRAND ABSOLUT IN MIND
Create is an important word as it nods to our heritage and is an active invitation. We have always been a canvas for creative expression.
Today’s canvas has changed- it’s no longer just the lone artist’s domain: it’s all about collective creativity, bottom-up, democratized.
It’s a joyful provocation to human ingenuity that inspires movements of positive change. We are proud of the progress we’ve been a part of to date, and we are excited to continue being supportive change agents: inspiring, encouraging, joining in, fueling positive change.
Whether that’s a better vodka, a better moment with friends, a better society: drive progress and never settle for the stable status quo.
The younger generations’ drive for progress is aspirational to older generations, as values are shared.
Together is core to our belief in inclusivity. Together is not about blending in or losing your individuality. It’s about the power of a diverse and multi-dimensional collective coming together and collaborating. Together is what makes the Absolut community. Together is what makes enjoying Absolut. Together is what drives human progress. Together, “we” are inspired and have more fun. At the same time, "I” will enrich others with my unique individuality and grow from exposure to different perspectives.
OUR TONE OF VOICE
BOLD: We are daring and push boundaries. We state our point of view with confidence but never arrogance. We are for, not against.
WITTY: We combine fun with a clever twist, and rule at brilliant word play. We make people smile by making people think.
CREATIVE: We have a spark inside us and think that creative energy is mind opening. We like edgy and express ourselves through contemporary culture.
INVITING: We welcome everyone. We think all humans are equal and should be included. We enjoy collaborating and greet you to come visit our Swedish homeland.
